                <h2>DITL - Quality Controller (Fishing Industry)</h2>
                <p>
                  It can be difficult sometimes to have an idea of what you wish
                  to specialize in after graduating. You might find yourself
                  wondering, what am I actually going to do? In this post, you
                  can find some information about quality control work in the
                  fishing industry in Namibia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Smith Andrew Thikusho is a dear colleague and friend of mine.
                  We met in the tiny library of UNAM Neudamm Campus in 2020. He
                  has experience in Quality management and surveying. This is
                  his story.

                    it?</b
                  >
                  <br />
                  ''I found out about the course of food science and technology
                  through a career guidance event that was hosted at my high
                  school, Etosha Secondary School. The career guidance was
                  hosted by a team of staff from the University of Namibia
                  (UNAM) in 2016. There were a few reasons why I chose the
                  course Food Science and Technology. Firstly, I love science.
                  Food science and technology is a science-based course despite
                  it being under the faculty of agriculture at UNAM. The study
                  of biology, chemistry, and physical science has always excited
                  me. Secondly, the career guidance emphasized the importance of
                  agriculture and food security to Namibia, and that not only
                  got my attention but ignited a passion in me seeing my
                  background as a poor and starving African child so I decided
                  to pursue the course in hopes that I could be impactful in
                  helping my country produce high quality and safe food products
                  for the citizens including myself''.

                  "I started my journey with food science and technology in 2017
                  and completed it in 2020. I graduated in 2021. The journey
                  since graduation hasn’t been sunshine and rainbows. I had a
                  few opportunities to use my qualification. I worked at the
                  Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)
                  GmbH (GIZ) and Etosha Fishing Corporations".

                    >Could you explain, in basic terms, what you do? What are
                    your major responsibilities?</b
                  >
                  "At GIZ I worked as a field surveyor. I investigated the
                  eating habits of people. What types of food they ate and how
                  often they ate it? Whether or not there were specific foods
                  restricted to certain age groups or genders etc.
                  <br />
                  My time at Etosha Fishing Corporation was spent as a quality
                  controller. My responsibilities included mainly the inspection
                  of the quality of raw materials (fish) received from
                  suppliers. I also oversaw the production process starting from
                  packaging materials, the sauces used as an ingredient, the
                  water for cleaning and cooking, through to the final finished
                  product. I inspected for defects in final products and
                  packaging such as dents or depressions in cans and rusts on
                  packaging which are all signs of hazards".

                  <b
                    >What other sort of tasks do you perform on a day-to-day
                    basis?</b
                  >
                  <br />
                  "My day-to-day tasks were determined by where I was placed by
                  my supervisor for a specific shift. As a quality controller,
                  you are expected to work at different stations and not all
                  quality controllers will have the same tasks for a specific
                  shift for that specific day. The stations are usually
                  laboratory work, hygiene inspection, fish feed, empty cans,
                  pre-cooking, after-cooking, and visual inspection. Each
                  station should have a quality controller who knows the
                  responsibilities by heart because you could be placed at any
                  station. There is a lot of paperwork and form filling involved
                  in quality control and it requires precision with little to no
                  mistakes. Personal qualities such as attention to detail,
                  quick thinking, execution, and problem-solving skills are very
                  important".

                  <b>Which classes from college do you use most often?</b>
                  <br />
                  "Contemporary Social Issues (CSI) and Rural Sociology were the
                  classes whose knowledge proved very useful. In a given work
                  environment there are different groups of individuals and
                  different tribes. It is very important to know how to interact
                  with different people and these classes proved to be very
                  valuable in this aspect. Quality Management Systems (QMS) was
                  another important class. This specific one is valuable in
                  every industry not just the food industry. It plays an
                  important role because all products being produced need to
                  meet consumer or regulatory requirements. Seafood Technology
                  was another important class based in the fishing industry.
                  Lastly, food toxicology is impactful as it made me more aware
                  of food contaminants and food defense which is the protection
                  of food from foreign materials, toxins, and contaminants.
                  Basic first-year modules such as biology and chemistry were
                  also valuable, especially knowledge on using and reading
                  instruments".

                  <br />
                  "Whatever field one chooses to pursue is up to them, however,
                  is it helpful to know the modules that you could be facing
                  down the line. You need to know what you are good at and
                  choose a career path that can support that as it will help you
                  to get better grades. Try to choose something that you can
                  manage. Don’t pursue a course due to peer pressure. Go for
                  something you will enjoy and love doing".

                  >
                  <br />
                  "Be smart. Understand what is being taught in the classes
                  because the economy is unforgiving. There is no guarantee that
                  within a few years or months of graduating you will secure a
                  good job. Things aren’t always that easy. It’s better to
                  understand the knowledge being shared as you could use it for
                  yourself in the future. Sound knowledge on developing your own
                  product from product development or starting and managing your
                  own business from Entrepreneurship can save you years of
                  unemployment. Do not memorize and focus only on passing and
                  clearing modules. Use your expertise with understanding so you
                  don’t have to return to your books to be able to solve
                  problems.
                  <br />
                  Agriculture is a foundation from which a nation can feed its
                  citizens. As a food scientist, you are not only helping the
                  fight against food insecurity, you are also building an
                  economy, improving nutrition and diets, and best you are
                  diversifying the food base of Namibia".
