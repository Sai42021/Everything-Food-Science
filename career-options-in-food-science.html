                <h2>CAREER OPTIONS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</h2>
                <p>
                  I always associated food science and technology with lab work. 
                  Perhaps the assumption came from nearly every professional, that 
                  I knew in the field, being either a laboratory technician, technologist, 
                  or lecturer. To top it off, our internship placements were almost always 
                  in labs (testing food quality) or in factories (food processing). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of my lecturers once asked me if I considered a career in nutrition. 
                  I responded by saying “I don’t know”. This was because I had never before 
                  considered a career in anything outside of academia, laboratories, and 
                  food processing. I basically didn’t know what my options were. I very recently 
                  learned that I love product development. Had you asked me a year back I 
                  would’ve expressed how boring I thought it was. The entire process from idea 
                  generation, testing, and finally prototyping just felt like a lot of work 
                  to me, but to my own surprise, I’ve learned that all I needed was a little 
                  exposure to help me realize what I truly enjoy doing and would consider 
                  doing down the line. 
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: #a24857">
                  The best part about food science is that it is attractive to people with unique interests. 
                  Whether it is a passion for food, innovation, cooking, management, or sustainability.

                  <b>Careers in Food Science and Technology </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Food Microbiology</b>
                  <br>
                  Food microbiologists ensure that food is safe to consume. They ensure that foods
                   comply with government health and safety regulations. Study the methods of 
                   food spoilage and methods of preservation. Establish food legislation. 
                   Food microbiologists can work in various industries such as food manufacturing 
                   companies, municipalities (city of Windhoek), mines, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Food Chemistry</b>
                  <br>
                  Food chemists develop and improve foods, analyze processing methods 
                  (cooking, canning, freezing, packing, etc), study the effects of processing on food, 
                  improve testing methods, etc. They design and apply methods to analyze the chemical 
                  nature of food. They work in labs, offices, farms, and processing plants. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Food Engineering </b>
                  <br>
                  Food engineering is a scientific, academic, and professional field. Food engineers apply 
                  principles of engineering, science, and mathematics to design and develop systems for 
                  food processing, storing, packaging, and handling. Food engineers can work in 
                  industry (for food manufacturing companies) and consulting, with job titles 
                  ranging from Process Engineer to Plant Manager. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Product Development</b>
                  <br>
                  This involves the creation of high-quality, nutritious, tasty, and innovative products. 
                  It involves crucial steps from ideation, ingredient selection, testing, and design 
                  to marketing and distribution. Every time you see a new product on market shelves, 
                  you can bet a few dollars that a food scientist was involved. The primary 
                  responsibilities of product developers are to research customer demand, develop 
                  concepts and formulate a complete market-viable product. Fun!

                  <b>Sensory Science</b>
                  <br>
                  Work to understand the characteristics of foods, how consumers perceive them, the appeal of 
                  food, safety, and nutrition. Study factors that influence food choices 
                  (flavor, texture, appearance, and consumer mood). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Quality Management – Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) </b>
                  <br>
                  QA Managers develop testing plans and techniques to optimize the quality testing and 
                  assurance process. They maintain a leadership position by managing the quality control 
                  laboratory and reviewing test results. To better understand the specific roles, 
                  knowing the difference between QC and QA is important. QA is a preventative practice 
                  that assures compliancy of lab practices with industry quality; while QC is a reactive 
                  process to recognize and solve quality issues in operations. This will be covered in 
                  detail in future posts since most recently graduated individuals take up QC and 
                  QA roles in Namibia.

                  <b>Nutritional therapist</b>
                  <br>
                  Work with clients and study their body type, composition, and nutritional deficiencies 
                  to develop customized and detailed plans to help people switch to more balanced diets 
                  that can help restore their bodies. Research says that Food Technologists are 
                  eligible for MSc courses in Nutrition and Dietetics so I guess a BSc in 
                  Food Science and Technology is a great start for those interested.

                  </b>
                  <br>
                  Food toxicologists conduct laboratory-based research and experiments to determine 
                  if a particular substance can be harmful (toxic). They detect, characterize the 
                  properties, study the fate of toxins in the body, and investigate the adverse 
                  effects of such toxins. <b>Do you know the natural toxin found in raw cassava?</b>

                  <p style="color: #a24857">Want to work for the City of Windhoek? </p>
                  Health inspectors make sure that commercial establishments such as food manufacturing plants, 
                  fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and any food service facilities comply with industry 
                  regulations on health and safety. They work for local, state, or private agencies.

                  <b>Food technology </b>
                  <br>
                  Food technologists research, develop and oversee the production of food. They study the physical, 
                  chemical, and biological properties of food and apply it to the selection, preservation, 
                  and processing of food. <b>Do you know the difference between food science and food technology?</b>
